### Design Patterns Utilized

### Logging Examples

### LBYL & EAFP

### Demo Video


- You are required to write a short description and link to your implememtation of the design patterns you use.
- You need to provide a description of how you used environment variables and link to your code to illustrate.
-  You need to explain and link to how you are using logging.
-  You need to link to and explain how you are using try/catch / exceptions to illustrate  "Look Before You Leap" (LBYL) and "Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission" (EAFP)/
- Create a 3-5 minute video demonstration of using the calculator, highlighting its key features and functionalities. Link the video to the repository readme.
-  Submit a link to your repository to Canvas.  
-  Keep your repository private while working on it, so people don't copy your work.  Make the repository public within a day of the project being due, so we can grade it.
- **REQUIRED - YOU MUST USE GITHUB ACTIONS AND YOUR CODE MUST PASS ALL THE TESTS ON GITHUB**
